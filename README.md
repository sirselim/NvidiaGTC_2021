# NvidiaGTC_2021
My 40min presentation for Nvidia Spring GTC 2021 on portable sequencing tech and Nvidia GPUs

There is a [pdf version](https://github.com/sirselim/NvidiaGTC_2021/blob/main/S31898%2BMilesBenton%2BTheDisruptiveNatureOfPortableSequencing.pdf) of the presentation slides available in this repository, as well as a link to the html version ([here](https://sirselim.github.io/NvidiaGTC_2021/)) - for best results I recomend either a Chrome-based browser or Firfox.
